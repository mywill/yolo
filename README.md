# Running Claude Code in a Container

This guide shows how to run claude-code in a Podman container while preserving your configuration and working directory access.

## Easy Setup (Recommended)

Clone the repository and run the setup script to build the container and optionally create a `YOLO` command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/con/yolo
cd yolo
./setup-yolo.sh
```

This will:
1. Build the container image if it doesn't exist
2. Optionally create a `YOLO` shell function
3. Configure everything for you

After setup, just run `yolo` from any directory to start Claude Code in YOLO mode!

By default, `yolo` preserves your original host paths to ensure session compatibility with native Claude Code. This means:
- Your `~/.claude` directory is mounted at its original path
- Your current directory is mounted at its original path (not `/workspace`)
- Sessions created in the container can be resumed in your native environment and vice versa

If you prefer the old behavior with anonymized paths (`/claude` and `/workspace`), use the `--anonymized-paths` flag:
```bash
yolo --anonymized-paths
```

### Git Worktree Support

When running in a git worktree, `yolo` can detect and optionally bind mount the original repository. This allows Claude to access git objects and perform operations like commit and fetch. Control this behavior with the `--worktree` option:

- `--worktree=ask` (default): Prompts whether to bind mount the original repo
- `--worktree=bind`: Automatically bind mounts the original repo
- `--worktree=skip`: Skip bind mounting and continue normally
- `--worktree=error`: Exit with error if running in a worktree

```bash
# Prompt for bind mount decision (default)
yolo

# Always bind mount in worktrees
yolo --worktree=bind

# Skip bind mounting, continue normally
yolo --worktree=skip

# Disallow running in worktrees
yolo --worktree=error
```

**Security note**: Bind mounting the original repo exposes more files and allows modifications. The prompt helps prevent unintended access.

### Project Configuration

You can create a per-project configuration file to avoid repeating command line options. The config is auto-created on first run, or you can use `yolo --install-config`:

```bash
# Auto-creates .git/yolo/config on first run in a git repo
yolo

# Or manually install/view config
yolo --install-config

# Edit with your preferences
vi .git/yolo/config
```

The configuration file is stored in `.git/yolo/` which means:
- It won't be tracked by git
- It won't be destroyed by `git clean`
- It works correctly with git worktrees (they all reference the same `.git` directory)

**Example configuration** (`.git/yolo/config`):
```bash
# Volume mounts with shorthand syntax
YOLO_PODMAN_VOLUMES=(
    "~/projects"        # Mounts ~/projects at same path in container
    "~/data::ro"        # Mounts ~/data read-only at same path
)

# Additional podman options
YOLO_PODMAN_OPTIONS=(
    "--env=DEBUG=1"
)

# Arguments for claude
YOLO_CLAUDE_ARGS=(
    "--model=claude-3-opus-20240229"
)

# Default flags
USE_NVIDIA=1
```

**Volume shorthand syntax:**
- `"~/projects"` → `~/projects:~/projects:Z` (1-to-1 mount)
- `"~/data::ro"` → `~/data:~/data:ro,Z` (1-to-1 with options)
- `"~/data:/data:Z"` → `~/data:/data:Z` (explicit, unchanged)

Command line options always override configuration file settings. Use `--no-config` to ignore the configuration file entirely.

See `config.example` for a complete configuration template with detailed comments.

## First-Time Login

On your first run, you'll need to authenticate:

1. Claude Code will display a URL like `https://claude.ai/oauth/authorize?...`
2. Copy the URL and paste it into a browser on your host machine
3. Complete the authentication in your browser
4. Copy the code from the browser and paste it back into the container terminal

Your credentials are stored in `~/.claude` on your host, so you only need to login once. Subsequent runs will use the stored credentials automatically.

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to run commands manually, first build the image from the `images/` directory:

```bash
podman build --build-arg TZ=$(timedatectl show --property=Timezone --value) -t con-bomination-claude-code images/
```

Then run (with original host paths preserved by default):

```bash
podman run -it --rm \
  --userns=keep-id \
  -v "$HOME/.claude:$HOME/.claude:Z" \
  -v ~/.gitconfig:/tmp/.gitconfig:ro,Z \
  -v "$(pwd):$(pwd):Z" \
  -w "$(pwd)" \
  -e CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.claude" \
  -e GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/tmp/.gitconfig \
  con-bomination-claude-code \
  claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

Or with anonymized paths (old behavior):

```bash
podman run -it --rm \
  --userns=keep-id \
  -v ~/.claude:/claude:Z \
  -v ~/.gitconfig:/tmp/.gitconfig:ro,Z \
  -v "$(pwd):/workspace:Z" \
  -w /workspace \
  -e CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/claude \
  -e GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/tmp/.gitconfig \
  con-bomination-claude-code \
  claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

⚠️ **Note**: This uses `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to bypass all permission prompts. This is safe in containerized environments where the container provides isolation from your host system.

## What's Included

The base image is intentionally minimal — it includes Claude Code CLI, core shell utilities (git, vim, zsh, jq, fzf, etc.), and git-delta. Language runtimes (Rust, Node, Python) and project-specific system libraries are **not** included in the base image. Instead, use `.yolo/` setup scripts to add exactly what each project needs (see below).

See the [Dockerfile](images/Dockerfile) for the complete list of base packages.

## Per-Project Setup

Place setup scripts in a `.yolo/` directory at the root of your project to customize the container image with project-specific dependencies:

```
your-project/
  .yolo/
    root-setup.sh   # Runs as root during image build (apt-get install, etc.)
    user-setup.sh   # Runs as claude user during image build (rustup, nvm, uv, etc.)
```

Either script is optional — include only what you need.

**How it works:**
1. `yolo` detects `.yolo/` scripts and hashes their contents + the base image ID
2. If a derived image with that hash exists, it's used directly (cache hit)
3. Otherwise, a new image is built from the base with your scripts applied
4. Use `--rebuild` to force a rebuild if needed

**Example** — adding Node.js to your project:
```bash
mkdir .yolo
cat > .yolo/user-setup.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
set -e
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
nvm install --lts
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
EOF
yolo  # builds derived image, then starts claude with node available
```

See `images/examples/` for ready-to-use templates:
- **`rust/`** — build-essential, libssl-dev, rustup
- **`python/`** — uv (Python package manager)
- **`node/`** — nvm, Node.js LTS, corepack/pnpm
- **`tauri/`** — WebKit/GTK libs, Rust, Node.js, pnpm
- **`full/`** — everything (replicates the old monolithic image)

## Command Breakdown

### Default Behavior (Preserved Host Paths)

- `--userns=keep-id`: Maps your host user ID inside the container so files are owned correctly
- `-v "$HOME/.claude:$HOME/.claude:Z"`: Bind mounts your Claude configuration directory at its original path with SELinux relabeling
- `-v ~/.gitconfig:/tmp/.gitconfig:ro,Z`: Mounts git config read-only for commits (push operations not supported)
- `-v "$(pwd):$(pwd):Z"`: Bind mounts your current working directory at its original path
- `-w "$(pwd)"`: Sets the working directory inside the container to match your host path
- `-e CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.claude"`: Tells Claude Code where to find its configuration (at original path)
- `-e GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/tmp/.gitconfig`: Points git to the mounted config
- `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`: Skips all permission prompts (safe in containers)
- `--rm`: Automatically removes the container when it exits
- `-it`: Interactive terminal

This default behavior ensures that session histories and project paths are compatible between containerized and native Claude Code environments.

### Anonymized Paths (Old Behavior with --anonymized-paths)

When using `--anonymized-paths`, paths are mapped to generic container locations:
- `-v ~/.claude:/claude:Z`: Mounts to `/claude` in container
- `-v "$(pwd):/workspace:Z"`: Mounts to `/workspace` in container
- `-w /workspace`: Working directory is `/workspace`
- `-e CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/claude`: Config directory is `/claude`

## Tips

1. **Persist configuration**: The `~/.claude` bind mount ensures your settings, API keys, and session history persist between container runs

2. **Session compatibility**: By default, paths are preserved to match your host environment. This means:
   - Sessions created in the container can be resumed outside the container using `claude --continue` in your native environment
   - Each project maintains its own session history based on its actual path (e.g., `/home/user/project`)
   - You can seamlessly switch between containerized and native Claude Code for the same project

   **Note**: With `--anonymized-paths`, all projects appear to be in `/workspace`, which allows `claude --continue` to retain context across different projects that were also run with this flag. This can be useful for maintaining conversation context when working on related codebases.

3. **File ownership**: The `--userns=keep-id` flag ensures files created or modified inside the container will be owned by your host user, regardless of your UID

4. **Git operations**: Git config is mounted read-only, so Claude Code can read your identity and make commits. However, **SSH keys are not mounted**, so `git push` operations will fail. You'll need to push from your host after Claude Code commits your changes.

5. **Multiple directories**: Mount additional directories as needed:
   ```bash
   yolo -v ~/projects:~/projects -v ~/data:~/data -- "help with this code"
   ```
   Or with anonymized paths:
   ```bash
   yolo --anonymized-paths -v ~/projects:/projects -v ~/data:/data -- "help with this code"
   ```

## Security Considerations

YOLO mode runs Claude Code with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, providing unrestricted command execution within the container. The container provides isolation through:

- **Filesystem boundaries**: Only `~/.claude`, `~/.gitconfig`, and your current working directory are accessible to Claude
- **Process isolation**: Rootless podman user namespace isolation (`--userns=keep-id`)
- **Limited host access**: SSH keys and other sensitive files are not mounted

**What is NOT restricted:**

- **Network access**: Claude can make arbitrary network connections from within the container (to package registries, APIs, external services, etc.)

**When to be cautious:**

- **Untrusted repositories**: Malicious code comments or documentation could exploit prompt injection to trick Claude into executing harmful commands or exfiltrating data
- Mounting directories with sensitive data (credentials, private keys, confidential files)
- Projects that access production systems or databases

**For higher security needs**, consider running untrusted code in a separate container without mounting sensitive directories, or wait for integration with Anthropic's modern sandbox runtime which provides network-level restrictions.
